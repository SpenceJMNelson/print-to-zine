      <p>The 1619 Project has significantly changed our understanding of our American story. We are a country born out of slavery, the lasting effects of which are felt still today, over 400 years since the first captive Africans arrived in the Virginia Colony. In partnership with The New York Times, our client, the Pulitzer Center, has organized The 1619 Education Network, a learning community designed to create and share curricular resources based on this seminal project. </p>

      <p>The world that I knew has changed a lot since 2020. I spent the majority of the past two years doing whatever I could to make the most of any situation. Self-pity is not in my emotional vocabulary. And while I’m keenly aware of the deep-rooted systemic issues designed into our society, I am equally aware of how privileged I am and that I truly have it better than most.</p>

      <p>For those of you who know us and know us well, you understand what a big part music plays in the day-to-day conversation at Threespot. That dialogue was easier when we had an office and each of us could introduce others to our latest sonic obsession by commandeering the office Sonos. As we’ve been remote for the past two years, this never-ending musical discussion, like most others, has moved online to Slack.</p>
