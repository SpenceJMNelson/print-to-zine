       <h3>Learning from 1619</h3>

      <p>The 1619 Project has significantly changed our understanding of our American story. We are a country born out of slavery, the lasting effects of which are felt still today, over 400 years since the first captive Africans arrived in the Virginia Colony. In partnership with The New York Times, our client, the Pulitzer Center, has organized The 1619 Education Network, a learning community designed to create and share curricular resources based on this seminal project. </p>
      <div class="full-article">
        <p>To support this community and disseminate its tremendous resources, Threespot worked with the Pulitzer Center to create  <a href="https://1619education.org/">1619education.org</a>. On this portal, teachers can find curricula, reading guides, podcasts, and ways to connect through webinars. Lesson plans and activities help students think about what it means to share a national identity and a complex history. They also invite students to reflect on their cultural identity and build empathy.</p>
<p>The site was launched to coincide with the release of Nikole Hannah-Jones’ book  <a href="https://1619books.com/"><em>The 1619 Project: A New Origin Story</em></a>, which expands her original 1619 collection by weaving together new essays and creative works that illuminate crucial moments of origin, oppression, struggle, and resistance.</p>
<p>The 1619 Project has become a hot topic of debate and has met some fierce backlash from angry, politically-motivated groups at school board meetings across the country. It has been embroiled in the manufactured controversy over the alleged teaching of critical race theory in K-12 classes, with calls by some legislators to ban the book and its ideas from being taught in schools.</p>
<p>While this fomented rage is alarming, it highlights how powerful and necessary this project is. To overcome the deep roots of systemic racism, we must confront the full history of our nation’s past. The best counter to the criticism comes from seeing the incredible student response in their classwork. Lessons taught from the 1619 curricula sparked meaningful discussions among students on race, identity, hope, determination, and community. They are learning compassion and building their skills in critical thinking while learning a more holistic, nuanced history than many of us were taught in grade school. It’s motivating to see the phenomenal  <a href="https://1619education.org/blog/educators-share-resources-and-insights-1619-project-classroom">student poetry, short fiction, art, and music inspired by the 1619 essays</a>. Dignity, self-esteem, healing, and hope are precisely the lessons we need our young people to learn now to open up possibilities of equity and justice in the future.</p>
<p>The 1619 Project places the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the center of our national narrative. For the first time, students and teachers have a scholarly framework to consider the paradoxical truth that our country, purportedly founded on the principles of freedom, participated in the horrific, legal enslavement of people. Jake Silverstein, editor in chief of  <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>,  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/20/magazine/1619-intro.html">reminds us why this work is so consequential</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>American history cannot be told truthfully without a clear vision of how inhumane and immoral the treatment of Black Americans has been. By acknowledging this shameful history, by trying hard to understand its powerful influence on the present, perhaps we can prepare ourselves for a more just future. That is the hope of this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s been an honor to be part of this landmark project working with the Pulitzer Center and our development partner, Inclind, to help students better understand themselves and our country through a more nuanced telling of our history.</p>

      <h3>2022: All Things Considered</h3>
      <img src="img/img2.jpg">
      <p><em>Liz Ott, President</em></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="zine-panel-wrapper z-panel-4">
    <div class="zine-panel-content">
      <p>The world that I knew has changed a lot since 2020. I spent the majority of the past two years doing whatever I could to make the most of any situation. Self-pity is not in my emotional vocabulary. And while I’m keenly aware of the deep-rooted systemic issues designed into our society, I am equally aware of how privileged I am and that I truly have it better than most.</p>
      <div class="full-article">
        <p>After nearly two years of making the most of life during COVID, a sense of ennui really settled in for me towards the end of 2021. The post-vaccine confidence that I had slowly amassed (e.g., occasionally eating in restaurants, hanging indoors with friends and coworkers, or planning events and small gatherings) abruptly dissipated as I started to see the rules of COVID operation change and confound us all in this new omicron phase of the pandemic. We are all there.  <em>How can we keep doing this?</em></p>
        <p>Where does that leave us as we look ahead? How do we find peace, inspiration, joy, or [fill in the blank] in 2022? I’ll break it down to a more real place—how can we hold on to our sanity when the ground underneath us continues to shift?</p>
        <p>For those of us working in the nonprofit sector, this year is too important with midterm elections ahead to let all the anguish stand in the way. We still have work to do but we need a communal jump start.</p>
        <p>Since we can’t predict the future of COVID, we need to accept that everything is in motion and will continue to be. We need to find a way to  <em>exist in that motion.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Go the speed limit.</strong></p>
        <p>After I was finally vaccinated, I quickly resumed a pace of life that was faster and busier than I like. I told myself to slow down, to hold on to the aspects of my pandemic life that I appreciated.</p>
        <p>Every time I’ve visited another country I’ve come back thinking about what I appreciated most about the lifestyle of its inhabitants and how I can incorporate it into my typically fast-paced, East-coast American mode of living. Mostly, I notice how in so many countries I’ve experienced, people move more slowly and enjoy life more. Let’s do that now. Let’s find ways to embrace aspects of pandemic life without returning to the blurring sprint of before.</p>
        <p><strong>Enjoy the journey.</strong></p>
        <p>As a young kid, I packed a bag of activities when I had to go with my mom to work. I hated feeling bored. My friend’s late father always paraphrased a  <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=98a2011e5b&amp;e=57dd2b21da">poem</a>in response to our complaints of boredom. “If you are bored, you have no inner resources,” he would say. In order to find your inner resources, “you have to embrace all those small moments. Pay attention to the little details, gestures, and smiles you come across in a day. Acknowledge them, appreciate them.”</p>
        <p>Wishing things would be “back to normal” doesn’t make them go back to normal. We are where we are now, so let’s take in the scenery, share the ride with our fellow travelers, and find whatever magic we can in whatever is right in front of us.</p>
        <p><strong>Just keep driving.</strong></p>
        <p>I am making a vow to stop saying “I’m good… All things considered.” It is such a loaded phrase and when I break it down:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>I’m good = I have no REAL personal complaints. I got a roof over my head, food in my fridge, an adorable dog, and an enormous community of support.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>All things considered = I am heartbroken by the state of the world today. I am sick of seeing the injustice that exists all around. I am worried about the state of education for our kids, our democracy, our environment and I don’t want to see any more people dying of this disease.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Put together, it feels a lot like paralysis. Like I’m so focused on remaining positive that I am ignoring the massive problems and issues surrounding us all. However, this is not really paralysis. While the “all things considered” makes it feel like we have no control over this journey, we actually do have a hand on the steering wheel. If you acknowledge your own agency to take action in whatever way you can, no matter how small, you can find a way to bring back that fire to keep at it. To appreciate what we do have in life and embrace the moments that fill us with joy and, perhaps, spread that joy to others along for the ride.</p>
        <p>In 2022, I want to spend more days trying new routes and moving just fast enough to keep the momentum. Now isn’t the time to ignore the impact the state of our communities is having on us. Now is the time to consider all the things ahead of us and brave this journey forward together</p>

      <h3>The Music That Motivated Us in 2021</h3>

      <p>For those of you who know us and know us well, you understand what a big part music plays in the day-to-day conversation at Threespot. That dialogue was easier when we had an office and each of us could introduce others to our latest sonic obsession by commandeering the office Sonos. As we’ve been remote for the past two years, this never-ending musical discussion, like most others, has moved online to Slack.</p>
      <div class="full-article">
        <p>Before I get too far, let me state that we have a proud tradition of highly opinionated Spots who are not afraid to let you know where they stand on an issue, and I mean literally any issue. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our #food Slack channel, where recent polls generated much heated debate. Let me break it down for you.</p>

        <p>An apparently dead simple poll about Horseradish (Yes/No) garnered 46 comments, including eye-opening truths about wasabi.</p>

        <p>One concerning the “Optimal Fried Pickle Format” (Chips or Spears) resulted in 45 comments (the chips won). </p>

        <p>A poll about the best type of breakfast sandwich (egg & cheese, or egg, sausage, & cheese, and so on...) devolved over the course of 75 comments into an argument about which bread was best for said sandwich and culminated in (to what some would say is) undue hostility towards the humble English muffin.</p>

        <p>In contrast, the conversations about music at Threespot remain passionate but are also generous, less about arguments and more about sharing our love of music with one another. Every year for at least the past decade, we have shared year-end playlists in the hopes of introducing each other to the music that moved us the past year. We’ve detailed this annual tradition, dubbed “MixSpot,” on Medium in 2018, 2019, and most recently in this newsletter for 2020.</p>

        <p>We’re currently working on prepping our playlists to share with one another, so we’d like to take this opportunity to invite you to follow us on our Spotify account, where we’ll be posting the results later this week. In the meantime, you can listen to a few playlists born from some of this past year’s internal debates, like what is the most egregious cover song of all time (side by side with the originals for comparison) as well as some of our favorite divas.</p>
